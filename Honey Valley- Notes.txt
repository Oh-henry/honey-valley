Benefits of Honey 

	-Rich in Antioxidants 
	- Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a batural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals know as"active" honey have also been utilised throughtout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties. 
	
	-Natural cough medicine 
	- honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore thraot. According to one study, it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. you can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 rteaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon

	- Lowers Blood Pressure 
	- Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is becuase it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.

	-Improves Cholesterol 
	- Studies have shown that consumming honey lowers LDL(bad) cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. honey may also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%
	
	Improves Heart Health
	- It's high antioxidants,such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may support better health. Small studies in humnas show honey's antioxants could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those findings.

	antibacterial properties
	-  honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. it also has a high sugar content, which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehyrated and die off.
